        <article>
          <p>A new study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters has found that planting trees can significantly reduce urban heat. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Georgia and the U.S. Forest Service, analyzed the impact of tree cover on summer temperatures in 97 cities across the United States. They found that in cities with more tree cover, temperatures were up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than in cities with less tree cover.</p>
  
          <p>The researchers also found that the benefits of trees in reducing urban heat were greatest in the most densely populated areas, where there is typically less green space. In these areas, the presence of trees can reduce temperatures by as much as 25 degrees Fahrenheit. The study's lead author, Dr. Brian Stone Jr., noted that "increasing tree cover in urban areas could be a cost-effective way to mitigate the urban heat island effect and make cities more livable."</p>
  
          <p>The findings of the study have important implications for urban planning and climate mitigation efforts. As cities continue to grow and become more densely populated, the urban heat island effect is becoming an increasingly pressing issue. By planting more trees in urban areas, city planners and policymakers can help to reduce temperatures and make cities more comfortable and livable for their residents. Additionally, the study suggests that increasing tree cover could be a relatively low-cost way to mitigate the impacts of climate change in urban areas.</p>

        <h4 class="heading-4">Government pledges to phase out single-use plastics by 2030"</h4>
        <p>The government has announced plans to phase out single-use plastics by 2030 in a bid to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment. Under the new proposals, products such as plastic straws, drink stirrers, and cotton buds will be banned from sale in England from April 2020. The government also plans to extend the plastic bag charge to all retailers and increase the charge from 5p to 10p. The measures are part of a wider strategy to tackle plastic pollution and move towards a more sustainable and circular economy. The government hopes that the new initiatives will encourage individuals and businesses to think more carefully about their use of plastic and help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the environment.

        <p>
          Conservationists have successfully reintroduced an endangered species to its natural habitat in a major step towards protecting the species from extinction. The species, which had previously suffered from habitat loss and hunting, was bred in captivity before being released into the wild. The reintroduction program was carefully planned and monitored to ensure that the animals had the best possible chance of survival. The success of the program has been hailed as a major victory for conservation efforts and provides hope for other endangered species. The reintroduction of the species to its natural habitat is an important step towards protecting biodiversity and ensuring that ecosystems remain healthy and functional.

        <p>
          Scientists have developed a biodegradable plastic alternative made from shrimp shells that could help reduce plastic waste. The new material, called chitosan, is derived from chitin, the main component of shrimp shells. Unlike traditional plastics, chitosan can biodegrade in a matter of weeks, breaking down into harmless substances. The material also has the added benefit of being antimicrobial, which could make it suitable for use in medical applications. The researchers behind the development of chitosan hope that it could be used as a sustainable alternative to single-use plastics in packaging and other products. The production of chitosan also has the potential to create new revenue streams for the seafood industry by making use of waste products that would otherwise be discarded. </p>
